Combat Tracker to...well...track D&D combat.

This simple program can create new combats each time in which a user will add combatants to the combat to track.
Each combatant has a name, initiative and health to track.
Once the combat starts, it will put the combatants in order by their initiative as well as display their health.
A user can then put the damage that that combatant has taken and put it in the entry box and the tracker will
automatically do the math for that user.
If the combatants health hits zero, they are removed from the combat and the order is changed to reflect that!

This is only a very very early version of this tracker and there are more updates surely to come in the future!
If you have ideas for this tracker, please reachout and email me at matthengl21@gmail.com

TO RUN:
Go to the releases and download the .exe file.
Once downloaded, run the .exe file from wherever you downloaded it to.
Once you run it, a LOG folder will be created. This is so if there is an issue then you can email me the problem with the LOGS
file and then I can figure out what's wrong!
Once you start the program, just have to hit "New Combat".
Enter the Combat Name.
You can click "Add Combatant" to add a new combatant.
Enter in their name, health and initiative.
Once you wanna start combat, just hit "Start Combat!"
